						<td class="text-center">ZCash is a cryptocurrency and blockchain that was created in 2016 when a group of academics decided they wanted to make a cryptocurrency that was similar to Bitcoin but had a few more characteristics. They created a Bitcoin blockchain split that offers improved privacy and security for users. Zerocoin, which was first created by the scientists, soon changed its name to Zerocash. The cryptocurrency was eventually rebranded as ZCash.</td>

						<td class="text-center">Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that emerged from a fork of the Bitcoin network in 2011. It was originally intended to solve the developer's fears that Bitcoin was becoming too centrally controlled and make it more difficult for large-scale mining businesses to obtain an advantage in mining. While the cryptocurrency was ultimately unsuccessful in keeping commercial miners from controlling the majority of Litecoin mining, it has evolved into a minable coin and a peer-to-peer payment system.
